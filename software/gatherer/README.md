# Data gatherer

This is a small example of a program that interacts remotely with the [example interface](../example_interface/README.md) (possibly on a microcontroller) and gathers the measured data into a file.
None of this software is supposed to be used **directly** by an integrator.
This exists just to showcase a software that could be implemented in, e.g., the main computer of a satellite, to interract with a payload hardware of MiniPIX (microcontroller + MiniPIX).

More info and context in the general [README](../README.md).
